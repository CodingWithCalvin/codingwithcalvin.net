### Overview
We should create an "Open Source Projects" page for the website that highlights open source contributions and individual projects. This will showcase the open source work done under the CodingWithCalvin brand.

### Key Features
1. **Landing Page**:
    - Similar layout to the current blog posts page.
    - Display all open source projects as cards with cover images.
    - Provide basic details such as project name, a short description, tech stack, and possibly an indicator (e.g., stars or active status).

2. **Details Page**:
    - For each project card, clicking should lead to a dedicated details page.
    - Include the following information:
      - Extended project description.
      - Key achievements or goals.
      - How to contribute.
      - Links to the code repository.
      - Screenshots, if available.

### Possible Implementation Steps
- Develop an API or backend service to fetch project details dynamically (optional if a static setup suffices).
- Create reusable components for the card layout and details page.
- Decide on the tech stack for the backend (if applicable).
- Style the pages to align with the existing design theme.

### Design Notes
- Consider applying the site-wide color palette.
- Leverage responsive design to ensure cross-device compatibility.

### Benefits
- Highlights your open source contributions.
- Inspires and informs site visitors about the CodingWithCalvin brand and projects.
- Encourages engagement from the open source community via contributions or feedback.

### Next Steps
- Discuss and approve the content structure.
- Assign tasks for development and design.
- Plan a release timeline.
