        I've been called many things in this life; the above list representing just a small sample. Of course, my favorite is "dada" - followed closely by whatever my wife calls me at the time, assuming I'm not in trouble for something.

        <p>Technology has provided so much for my family and me, and this blog, my open source projects, etc., are just a couple of the ways I try to give back to the community.</p>

        <p>So stick around, check out my multitude of posts and projects, and let me know if I can help you with anything.</p>
